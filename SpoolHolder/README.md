Mount for a Ender-style spool holder with spacing for a 3mm panel on top of 2020 extrusions.  This thing is based on Renaissance3DStudio's redo of the stock Ender spool holder mushed together with the bottom of the Voron 2.4 spool mount.  I borrowed the "teeth" and screw hole locations from Voron, grafted them onto the spool holder, and added space for the 3mm plexi panels on the outside of the Voron.  This should fit on anything with a 2020 extrusion and a 3mm panel on one side.  Attaches with an M5 screw.

Note the pictured spool holder itself obviously isn't included.  That one is [Spool Holder by Tek_3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4881187), which I recommend highly.


You'll need a little bit of support under the "teeth" on the end.  You'll probably need to file them down a little bit on the supports side after printing to fit in the 2020 extrusion.  Even with supports, they "sag" enough to throw the size off by about a layer's worth.

Note: 2020-3mmpanel-filament-spool-holder.stl is the file you want to print.  The rest of the STL's are intermediate steps used in fixing holes in the source STL's that cause problems for OpenSCAD.
